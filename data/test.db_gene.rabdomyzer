FBN1	FBN;MFS1;WMS	MASS;OCTD;SGS	NM_000138	uc001zwx.3	134797	fibrillin 1	.	.	FUNCTION: Fibrillin-1: Structural component of the 10-12 nm diameter microfibrils of the extracellular matrix, which conveys both structural and regulatory properties to load-bearing connective tissues (PubMed:1860873, PubMed:15062093). Fibrillin-1- containing microfibrils provide long-term force bearing structural support. In tissues such as the lung, blood vessels and skin, microfibrils form the periphery of the elastic fiber, acting as a scaffold for the deposition of elastin. In addition, microfibrils can occur as elastin-independent networks in tissues such as the ciliary zonule, tendon, cornea and glomerulus where they provide tensile strength and have anchoring roles. Fibrillin-1 also plays a key role in tissue homeostasis through specific interactions with growth factors, such as the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), growth and differentiation factors (GDFs) and latent transforming growth factor-beta-binding proteins (LTBPs), cell- surface integrins and other extracellular matrix protein and proteoglycan components (PubMed:27026396). Regulates osteoblast maturation by controlling TGF-beta bioavailability and calibrating TGF-beta and BMP levels, respectively (By similarity). Negatively regulates osteoclastogenesis by binding and sequestering an osteoclast differentiation and activation factor TNFSF11. This leads to disruption of TNFSF11-induced Ca2+ signaling and impairment of TNFSF11-mediated nuclear translocation and activation of transcription factor NFATC1 which regulates genes important for osteoclast differentiation and function (PubMed:24039232). Mediates cell adhesion via its binding to cell surface receptors integrins ITGAV:ITGB3 and ITGA5:ITGB1 (PubMed:12807887, PubMed:17158881). Binds heparin and this interaction has an important role in the assembly of microfibrils (PubMed:11461921). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q61554, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11461921, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12807887, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15062093, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17158881, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1860873, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24039232, ECO:0000303|PubMed:27026396}.; 	DISEASE: Marfan syndrome (MFS) [MIM:154700]: A hereditary disorder of connective tissue that affects the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. A wide variety of skeletal abnormalities occurs with Marfan syndrome, including scoliosis, chest wall deformity, tall stature, abnormal joint mobility. Ectopia lentis occurs in most of the patients and is almost always bilateral. The leading cause of premature death is progressive dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, causing aortic incompetence and dissection. Neonatal Marfan syndrome is the most severe form resulting in death from cardiorespiratory failure in the first few years of life. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10425041, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10441597, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10694921, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11700157, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11826022, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12161601, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12203992, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12402346, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1301946, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14695540, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15161917, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15221638, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1569206, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16220557, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16222657, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17657824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18435798, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1852208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19533785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20803651, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21542060, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22772377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7611299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7738200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7762551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7870075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7951214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7977366, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8004112, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8040326, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8071963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8136837, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8281141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8406497, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8504310, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8863159, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8882780, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9016526, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9254848, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9338581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9401003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9837823, ECO:0000269|Ref.68}.
